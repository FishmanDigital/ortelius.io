## SBOM Consumption for Every Artifact

Ortelius is the go-to platform for DevOps and security engineers to view and analyze Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) data. The Ortelius vulnerability evidence store collects SBOMs for every artifact update. It then aggregates the SBOM to all consuming logical applications, providing consolidated SBOMs in decoupled architecture. 

In a decoupled architecture, each independently deployed container triggers its own pipeline, generating its own SBOM. For this reason, SBOM data becomes fragmented across artifacts and most often, left in the build directory where the pipeline was executed. This makes it difficult to get a complete view of a software applicationâ€™s security profile, including any vulnerabilities overtime. Ortelius solves this by aggregating SBOM data, providing CISO and development teams with a comprehensive view of critical software supply chain intelligence for fast, informed responses to cyber threats.

Most importantly, Ortelius continuously scans OSV.dev and reports new vulnerabilities found after the software was deployed.

## Logical Application SBOMs

In a decoupled architecture, component updates drive new application versions. Each time a shared component is updated, all of the consuming 'logical' applications have new SBOMs. Because Ortelius versions every component update, it automatically provides a new aggregated application level SBOM. This information is critical for meeting Government SBOM requirements such as [EO 14028](https://www.gsa.gov/technology/it-contract-vehicles-and-purchasing-programs/information-technology-category/it-security/executive-order-14028).
