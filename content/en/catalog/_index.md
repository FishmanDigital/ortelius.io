## Logical Application SBOMs

Ortelius aggregates Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) data across decoupled architectures to ensure comprehensive visibility, security, and compliance in modern software ecosystems. In decoupled systems, where services, applications, and components operate independently, each part may have its own dependencies, vulnerabilities, and licensing requirements. 

Aggregating SBOM data allows for a unified view of all software components and their supply chains. Ortleius helps organizations identify potential risks, manage vulnerabilities proactively, and maintain regulatory compliance. The Ortelius centralized oversight is essential for enhancing security posture, reducing blind spots, and ensuring that the entire architecture remains resilient and up-to-date despite its distributed nature.

The Ortelius aggregated SBOM is critical for meeting [Executive Order 14028 - Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity](https://www.gsa.gov/technology/it-contract-vehicles-and-purchasing-programs/information-technology-category/it-security/executive-order-14028).

## Continuous Vulnerability Updates

Using the stored SBOM data, Ortelius continuously scans for new vulnerabilities found long after the container was created. Continuous vulnerability scanning is essential because software systems are constantly evolving, and new security threats emerge regularly. As developers release updates, introduce new code, or integrate third-party components, new vulnerabilities may be inadvertently introduced.

By scanning for vulnerabilities continuously, Ortelius helps organizations detect potential weaknesses as soon as they arise, enabling faster remediation and reducing the window of opportunity for cyberattacks. Continuous scanning ensures that security measures remain up-to-date, minimizing the risk of breaches and ensuring compliance with security standards in an ever-changing threat landscape.
